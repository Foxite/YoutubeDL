# YoutubeDL
An android app using Xamarin that quickly downloads youtube videos as MP3. It uses [YoutubeExplode](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode) to achieve this.

Not affiliated with the popular command line tool.

## Installation
This app will likely never be released to Google Play. For an explanation, try to look up "youtube downloader" on the play store, and count the results you get.

You must either clone this project, build the app, and install it on your device, or [download a released apk](https://github.com/Foxite/YoutubeDL/releases).

## Instructions
Once installed, usage is very simple:

1. Open the app once and grant permission to read and write to the external storage.
2. Open the Youtube app and share a video to YoutubeDL (actually, you should be able to share any youtube link from anywhere, but I haven't tested this).
3. The main activity will open and immediately close (if everything worked out). At this point you can continue what you were doing, including sharing additional videos. After a few seconds a notification will pop up with the download progress. When finished, the mp3 will be placed in your downloads folder on the external storage.

## Disclaimer
This app was built in about 4 hours, purely for my convenience. Per the license, there is no guarantee that any part of it actually works. If this app fucks your phone, I will not be responsible.

This app is not monetized in any way.
